# AirQualityPrediction

Project corresponding to the course Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ID2223) at KTH. Team: LeScalable Frames (Jonas Lorenz and Álvaro Mazcuñán Herreros).



## Public access

This project is currently deployed in the following URL: [https://lescalableframes.streamlit.app/](https://lescalableframes.streamlit.app/). As you can see in `app.py`, this is a basic Streamlit frontend that shows the map of the sensors with their current values for PM2.5 and its predictions for the next 6 days. You could also find an easter-egg in the frontend.
